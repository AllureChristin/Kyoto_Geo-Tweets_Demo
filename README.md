# Kyoto_Geo-Tweets_Demo

This is a Demo of point of interest (POI) and Twitter check-in data (Tweets, about 2000 items)

We provide a Tweets data set on Google Maps,
but limited to the item display cap of Google Maps, only 200 Tweets can be checked.

You can check the detail of each Tweet item including:
ID,
Tweets description,
Location description,
Coordinates,
URL of Images,
Date.





Of Course, if you are good at the software of ArcGis or QGIS, it's easy to check the whole Geo-information of Map Tile 496.
